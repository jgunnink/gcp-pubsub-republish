# gcp-pubsub-republish
A script for republishing GCP Pub/Sub subscription messages to topics, made with the motivation of simplifying the replay of deadletter queue (DLQ) messages

Intended for you to take and customize for your own use.  GCP Pub/Sub implementations vary a lot and are often core to an application so my present thinking is that providing this snippet is more useful than providing a library.
